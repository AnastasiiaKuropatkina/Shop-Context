# React Shop Context for React course

This project is a simple e-commerce cart application where product data is fetched from the [Fortnite API](https://fortniteapi.io). Users can browse through the products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their selections. The key features include:

- **Fetching Products**: Product data is dynamically loaded via API.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart.
- **Edit Cart**: Items in the cart can be editedâ€”products can be added or removed.
- **Cart Summary**: The total amount of items in the cart is calculated and displayed.

This project demonstrates core functionality for managing a shopping cart using modern web development practices. It was created as part of a React course to practice React Hooks and the Fetch API.
